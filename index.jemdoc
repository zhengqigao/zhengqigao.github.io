== About me
Hi, I am a first year PhD student at MIT EECS, advised by Prof. Duane Boning.  Previously, I obtained my M.S. and B.E. from School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, where I worked closely with Prof. Jun Tao and Prof. [https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/xin-li Xin Li] (Duke Univ.) in the area of electronic design automation.

My current research interests lie mainly in design automation for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and machine learning. Before coming to MIT, I have been very lucky to work with Dr. [https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Departments/ECE/People/Faculty/RohrerRon Ron Rohrer] on the adjoint method and Prof. [http://people.csail.mit.edu/hangzhao/ Hang Zhao] on multimodal learning.
