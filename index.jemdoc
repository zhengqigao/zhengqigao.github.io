== About me
Hi, I am a third year PhD student at MIT EECS, advised by [https://boning.mit.edu/ Prof. Duane S. Boning].  Previously, I obtained my M.S. and B.E. from School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, where I worked closely with Prof. Jun Tao and Prof. [https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/xin-li Xin Li] (Duke Univ.) in the area of electronic design automation (specifically, Bayes methods for DFM). My current research interests lie mainly in design automation for photonic integrated circuits ([articles/Introduction_to_Photonic_Design_Automation.pdf What is it?]), novel computing paradigm (e.g., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15872 KirchhoffNet]), and applied machine learning. In the summer before coming to MIT, I was very lucky to work with Prof. [https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/rohrer-ronald.html Ron Rohrer] on the adjoint method and Prof. [http://people.csail.mit.edu/hangzhao/ Hang Zhao] on multimodal learning. I interned at Baidu, Shanghai Qizhi Insitute, and Nvidia Research. My research has been recognized with several honors, including being named an [https://mlcommons.org/2024/06/2024-mlc-rising-stars/ ML and Systems Rising Star] in 2024, an editor's highlight in Optica Photonics Research 2023, an ICLR'23 oral paper (top 5%), and the [https://www.cie.org.cn/list_43/4373.html Biren scholarship] (1 out of 3 nationwide) in 2020, among a few others.
